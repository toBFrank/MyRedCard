### A project by team Wet Laptop for HackED Beta 2022

#### Premise
---
With quizlet moving to a more pay-to-use system, it's become harder for students to find sites with easy tools to create, access, and use flashcards. Oftentimes when they do find a site, its flashcards are poorly made and underused. Our solution is a collectivized platform that allows students to create, share, and study from flashcards and notes for classes. Students can post flashcard sets and receive doots for their cards. Players vote on cards, giving the user who made them 'doots'. The karma of flashcards. The cards in sets with the most updoots frequently get compiled into a quiz which can be unlocked by using some of the updoots they've earned. In doing so, everyone wins. This is our reddit of flashcards. RedCard!
